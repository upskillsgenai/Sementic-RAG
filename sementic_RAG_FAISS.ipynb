            "A: The regenerative braking system in an electric vehicle (EV) works by converting the vehicle's kinetic energy back into electrical energy during braking or coasting. When the driver applies the brakes or releases the accelerator, the electric motor that normally propels the vehicle acts as a generator. \n",
            "\n",
            "As the vehicle slows down, the motor reverses its function and uses the motion of the vehicle to generate electricity. This electricity is then used to recharge the high voltage battery, effectively capturing energy that would otherwise be lost as heat in traditional braking systems. This process not only helps to extend the driving range of the EV by replenishing the battery but also contributes to overall energy efficiency.\n"
